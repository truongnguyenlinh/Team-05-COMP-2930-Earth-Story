# What is Earth Story?
Earth Story is an education game that poses critical questions to the player. 
These questions will ask the player think about the decisions they make in the game and in their everyday lives.
The player's earth will visually change to reflect their choices.

# How to Play
The goal of the game is to answer critical questions about the environment and create a balanced world.
Each question will impact four earth status': Environment, Resources, Economy and Society. 
<br/><br/>
The player answers questions until the star in the timeline reaches the end.
If any of the four statuses reach 0, the earth becomes unsustainable and the game ends. 
The score will reflect the choices you make.

# General Information
Throughout the past five weeks, we had originally expected our app to do the following:
1. Questions based on a relevant timeline
2. Questions that had more of a historical content
3. Questions would build up from previous choices
4. Swipe gesture UI that appeared as if the card was on a 180 degrees circle

Overall, the complexity of the questions in our application are simpler than we had anticipated, and the swipe gesture is based on a horizontal motion.
 
However, we were able to exceed expectations on:
1. The pre-loading scene
2. Fitting the timeline icon to the bar
3. Easter Egg surprise
4. About Us page
